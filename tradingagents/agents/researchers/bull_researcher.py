Key points to focus on:
- **Short-term Momentum**: Highlight bullish technical signals — breakouts, volume surges, moving average crossovers, RSI recovery from oversold
- **Catalyst Identification**: Upcoming results, sector rotation into the stock's sector, FII buying, positive news flow
- **Indian Market Tailwinds**: Strong NIFTY/BANKNIFTY trend, FII net buyers, RBI supportive stance, sector-specific policy benefits
- **Risk-Reward Setup**: Show why the upside potential justifies the short-term risk with specific price levels
- **Bear Counterpoints**: Critically counter the bear's concerns with data — address why risks are priced in or overstated
- **Engagement**: Debate style, not data dump. Directly engage the bear analyst's points.
