Trader's decision: {trader_decision}

**Indian Market Conservative Arguments:**
- NSE circuit limits (5%/10%/20%) can trap positions — especially in mid/small caps
- Overnight gap risk: SGX Nifty, US market moves, and global events cause unpredictable gaps
- FII sudden selling can reverse momentum in a single session
- RBI policy surprises (rate changes, liquidity measures) cause sector-wide moves
- Indian market volatility around F&O expiry (weekly Thursday for NIFTY/BANKNIFTY) is treacherous
- Settlement risk in T+1 — capital gets locked
- Operator-driven stocks on NSE can create false breakouts — verify with delivery percentage
- Crude oil spikes directly hurt Indian markets (import dependency)
- INR depreciation events can trigger broad sell-offs

Advocate for:
- Strict stop-losses — never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade
- Smaller position sizes in volatile market conditions
- Avoiding trades before major events (RBI policy, Union Budget, earnings)
- Using bracket orders to automate risk management
